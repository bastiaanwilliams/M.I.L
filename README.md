Mycroft Interface Linux
MyCroft Interface Linux is a very simple
program, script, to display a graphical interface 
for MyCroft Open Source AI.

I wrote this script and made some graphics, some from internet

It is nowhere professional or ment to be professional. 

I hope you will enjoy it, if not though luck :)
